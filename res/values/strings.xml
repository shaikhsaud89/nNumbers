    <string name="about_description">nNumbers collectively contains two modes: nPrimes and nDivisors. nPrimes allows you to find the first n prime numbers for a given n entered by the user. It uses Brute Force to compute the primes. Primes can be seen by clicking the show primes button. Primes of interest already found previously are retrieved and not recomputed. Using nDivisors, you can also find all divisors for a number and check whether that number is a prime or not. \n\nNOTE: \n*nPrimes can only accept values starting from 1 up to 9999. \n*nDivisors can only accept values starting from 1 up to 99999. \n*Since nPrimes uses Brute Force, it usually takes some time to find primes not previously found.</string>
